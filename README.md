# The Boxscore Challenge
The Boxscore is the goto widget on any sports site, to get quick information about a game.  ESPN, Fox Sports, theScore, and many others have solutions.

Here is ESPN’s solution. They even went ahead and added pitchers info.

The Boxscore challenge gives you the opportunity to use newer concepts and forces you to use best practices when it comes to its design and engineering.

### We want you to do the following:
* Spend some time researching the different boxscores out there.  Find things you love, and find things you hate.
* Design a solution.  
	* Pick your poison, Sketch or Photoshop.  Give us a quick design.
* Engineer your solution in Codepen.
	* Use whatever tools are familiar with you.  
* Must be responsive.
* No need to use a feed or anything for data.  Just use static numbers.

### Things to Consider
Think of the different states you need to take into consideration during the lifespan of a game.  Additionally, sports are structured differently.  For example, football has 4 quarters and displays the total score, while baseball has 9+ innings and displays not only the total score, but hits and errors.

As an engineer, we don’t want to be engineering multiple boxscores.  It should adapt to the data given

However, there are a lot of similarities.  All sports have two teams playing one another.  Away is on top, home is on the bottom.  There is always a spot that communicates where in the game we currently are (ie. Top 3rd, 1st Qtr, 3rd Period, Final)

### Deliverable
* Give us a Pen, with 3 different boxscores.
	* A baseball game, Top of the12th inning
	* A football game, Final
	* A hockey game, 1st Period

*Extra Credit*: Use javascript to populate the boxscores using JSON.
